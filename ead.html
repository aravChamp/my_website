                        <p>This has had the single greatest impact on my worldview.
                        <br>For so long it felt like I was forced to sit on the sidelines and I couldn’t have something I wanted so badly. This means that even though I've lived in the US my whole life, unlike my peers who started working at 16, I’m starting at 21.</br></p>
                        <p><br><b>Couldn’t you volunteer?</b> No, even startups get audited and they don’t want to hire someone who can’t get paid. In legal terms, you are taking the job away from someone who could get paid.</br></p>
                        <p><br><b>Why didn’t you switch to F1?</b> This would lead to a lifetime of difficulty trying to work in the US on an H1B; I didn’t switch out of my H4 status when I had already been waiting for so long. My family’s been on the greencard waitlist for 13 years.</br></p>
                        <p><br><b>Why didn’t you leave the country to get work experience or drop out of college?</b> Covid. I seriously considered dropping out but the degree meant a lot to my family and in retrospect I value the depth of information I learned.</br></p>
                        <p><br><b>Did you at least learn a lot by building projects?</b> Yes, I joined tech accelerators, lived in hacker houses, transferred schools, won hackathons, and worked at 2 research labs. Ultimately, there’s no substitute for good paid work experience. Your manager has a vested interest in mentoring you and as a result you have more motivation to keep going. Working with a team of people who I respect and can learn from is my deepest desire.</br></p>
                        <p><br>There have been a lot of strong emotions on this topic. Not being able to work is only part of what it meant for me and my family. When I finally got it a month before my 21st bday it felt like divine intervention. If I hadn’t have gotten it, my current status would be expired and I would’ve had to leave the US in September taking a leave of absence in my senior year of college in order to reapply for a visa which may or may not get rejected. Yes, this has happened to people in the past.</br></p> 
                        <p><br>If there’s anyone else out there on an H4 born in India living in the US, let me know if I can help.</br></p>
